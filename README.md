# rock-paper-scissors
Play rock, paper, scissors in your terminal

## How to run
1. Clone the repository and `cd` into the project directory
2. `go build` - this will create an executable `rock-paper-scissors` in the current directory.
3. `./rock-paper-scissors` will start the game.
4. you can also use the command `go run main.go` from the root of the project instead of steps 2 and 3 if you wish to tinker and compile the code each time.
